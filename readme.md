This is a very simple todo list app made with Laravel and ReactJS. I used it personally to list the tasks that I need to accomplish while learning web development.


How to use:

<ul>
  <li>Import the sql file from the database folder</li>
  <li>Configure your .env file</li>
  <li>Run npm install from the command line to add the JS dependencies.</li>
  <li>Run the app using 'php artisan serve' command.</li>
 </ul>
